# üß† Reddit Company Sentiment Analysis

This project analyzes Reddit posts about various companies to understand public sentiment, compare discussions, and identify key topics using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to extract Reddit posts related to specific companies and perform sentiment and text analysis to uncover insights such as:
- How people feel about each company (positive, negative, neutral)
- Common themes and frequently discussed topics
- Comparison of public perception across multiple companies

---

## üß© Features

- **Data Extraction:** Collected Reddit posts mentioning company names and related discussions.  
- **Text Preprocessing:** Used **spaCy** for tokenization, lemmatization, and normalization.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Applied **TF-IDF vectorization** to represent textual data numerically.  
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Classified sentiments using **BERT-based** and **VADER** models.  
- **Comparative Analysis:** Compared sentiment trends across companies to identify public perception differences.
